# Mission-1
Using a Markov Chain to Create Visual Art

I call this project: Automated Neighborhood Planning.

Personally Meaningful:
This project was meaningful to me because it was a callback to the very first serious coding project
that I ever did: Starry Night.  While thinking about what to create for this project, I kept remembering
Starry Night, and thinking about how far I have come as a computer scientist since I wrote that code. It has
been over 3.5 years!  I decided that working with the turtle python library on a more complicated project would
be an excited way to kind of measure myself againt my novice self from all of those years ago.  I decided on
neighborhood creation because my uncle works as a real estate developer, and whenever I see him we always talk 
about all of the decisions that go into creating neighborhoods that people don't really think about.  How many 
houses should there be?  How much natural terrain such as trees and forests should be nearby?  Will there be 
communal places for people to hangout together?  I thought about all of these factors and tried to implement
them within my Markov Chain project here.

Challenging Myself:
The part of this project that I challenged myself with was using the numpy python library.  I don't have any
experience with numpy, but I did some researching on markov chains and many poeple online recommended using it
to execute one in python.  I read the following article (https://www.upgrad.com/blog/markov-chain-in-python-tutorial/)
and went about trying to work from the basic ideas written.  Some of the code formatting I had never seen before, such
as the in line for loops, so I spent a decent amount of time using print statements trying to figure out what they did and
how they were helpful.  In the end I used normal for loops since I am more comfortable with them, but it was cool to get 
more exposure to different stylistic choices of loops, and in the future I believe that I can significantly cut down 
the length of my code by using these more sophisticated styles of loops.  I also think the numpy library could be useful in
future computational creativity projects, so I'm happy that I found it now.

Is This Creative?:
I do believe that this system is creative, but not in the way that art might be.  I think that when people would design
a neighborhood, which I did on paper many times before I set up this system, they all end up looking very similar.  Houses
are all adjascent on rows, there aren't too many communal spaces, and the forests/nature is often push aside to one small
area.  I think that by creating a system like this can expose countless set ups that a human designer may never have thought\
of, but when they look at them actually see how effective they could be.
